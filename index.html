        <h2>The Ultimate Guide to Self-Care</h2>
        <p class="text-content">
          Self-care is more than just face masks and bubble baths—it's about
          taking care of your mental, emotional, and physical well-being. Here's
          a simple guide to help you incorporate self-care into your life.
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Prioritize Your Mental Health</li>
          <p>
            Make time for activities that help reduce stress, such as
            journaling, meditation, or simply unplugging from digital devices
            for a while.
          </p>
          <li>Get Active</li>
          <p>
            Exercise is a powerful tool for improving mood and energy levels.
            Find an activity you enjoy, whether it's yoga, walking, or dancing,
            and make it a regular part of your routine.
          </p>
          <li>Practice Gratitude</li>
          <p>
            Taking a moment each day to reflect on what you're thankful for can
            boost your mood and outlook on life.
          </p>
          <li>Rest and Sleep</li>
          <p>
            Ensure you're getting enough rest by sticking to a consistent sleep
            schedule. Quality sleep is crucial for both physical and mental
            health.
          </p>
          <li>Pamper Yourself</li>
          <p>
            Take a relaxing bath, get a massage, or enjoy your favorite skincare
            routine. Treating yourself with kindness helps recharge your energy.
          </p>
          <li>Nourish Your Body</li>
          <p>
            Eating nutritious foods that fuel your body can improve your overall
            well-being. Focus on balanced meals that include a variety of
            vegetables, fruits, proteins, and whole grains.
          </p>
          <li>Set Boundaries</li>
          <p>
            Learning to say no when necessary is essential for your self-care.
            Set healthy boundaries with work, family, and friends to prevent
            burnout.
          </p>
          <li>Engage in Hobbies</li>
          <p>
            Do something you love, whether it's painting, reading, cooking, or
            anything else that brings you joy. Hobbies help you relax and
            unwind.
